# Student Exam Scores Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing student exam scores and related information. The goal is to explore the data, clean it, perform statistical analysis, and visualize key insights using Python.

## Dataset
- File used: `student-mat.csv`
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Student Performance Dataset)
- The dataset contains columns such as:
  - `G1`, `G2`, `G3` — Grades for three terms
  - `studytime` — Weekly study hours
  - `sex` — Gender of the student
  - And other demographic and academic features

## Key Tasks
1. Load and inspect the dataset.
2. Check for missing or duplicate data and clean as necessary.
3. Calculate:
   - Average final grade (`G3`)
   - Number of students scoring above 15 in `G3`
   - Correlation between study time and final grade
   - Average final grade by gender
4. Visualize data with histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts.

## Technologies Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
